# CS1230 - Computer Graphics - Final Project

To run this program, click the 'Upload Scene File' button and open the scene file inside the repo (finalproj_scene.xml)

Thanks for a great semester! :)

Note:
Out of the three members of this group project, we have noticed that the program sometimes functions strangely on M1/M2 machines. Though the application works as expected on Intel chips. We are unsure whether this is a chip issue or a QT issue, but the program itself functions as expected.
